# Wiiiiiiiiii
A small puzzle-platformer revolving around using a Wii remote to navigate the puzzles.

Supports mouse and keyboard, although a Wii remote is preferred.

## Development
Developed in Unity 2019.4.2f1

Inputs are handled by a wrapper derived from my <a href="https://github.com/Sparkfir3/wiimote-testing">Wiimote Testing</a> repository (updated from Unity 5.3.4f1), which uses Flafla2's <a href="https://github.com/Flafla2/Unity-Wiimote">Unity Wii Remote API</a>.
